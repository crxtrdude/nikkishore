## Notes

This game is designed for ZDoom primarily. GZDoom can also be used, but ZDoom compatibility is still retained for low spec computers who can only run ZDoom.

This game is still in its early planning stages.

## Building

The game requires Freedoom: Phase 2 to play. Get the most recent commit at [the Freedoom Git Builds site](http://freedoom.soulsphere.org).

This is laid out in the PK3 manner, see [the article] (http://zdoom.org/wiki/Using_ZIPs_as_WAD_replacement) on ZDoom Wiki for details.
